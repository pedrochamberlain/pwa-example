## What is a PWA?
- PWAs are browser based web applications (HTML5 / CSS / JavaScript). By using the latest browser features, they implement native app-typical capabilities and features, including all listed above. Running in a separate browser window without address bar, they are visually and functionally near-indistinguishable to apps. 
- "Progressive" means: A PWA must be designed to maintain basic functionality even if run offline and/or on a browser that does not support some features. 
- PWAs don’t install in the classical sense. An icon is added to the screen and advanced browser caching is used. The browser provides a secure execution environment to which PWAs are ‘installed’.
